### typing keyboard settings
- use US layout keyboard
- switch between german und us with `windows + space`
- set setting so windows remembers the language for each window
- use [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=102134) to create us keyboard layout with switches z and y key
- this way the german and us layout are identical for typing words, for coding I switch to US layout to get easy access to special chars
- for german text i just remember where the Umlaute are or will draw them on the US keyboard
- I switch the physical y and z key so they match my settings
